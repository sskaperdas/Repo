It is possible to reason in terms of clusters of statistics only if the basis for the collection and processing of these statistics (classifications, statistical units, etc) is sufficiently harmonised to qualify for potential integration. In business or household statistics significant efficiency gains could be generated via clustering.Example(s)Examples are business statistics and households statistics where the statistical unit is the same (enterprise and household respectively), classifications used are identical (for instance, NACE and CPA for business statistics, ISCED and ISCO for household statistics).  --https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/NLP4StatRef/ontology/hasCode-->  1718 (Probability: 0.056291695684194565)

While the sum of the expenditure on the different types of pension is always equal to total expenditure this is not the case for beneficiaries as an individual can receive multiple pensions simultaneously which leads to double counting if the numbers of beneficiaries for each type of pension are added up Such cases typically involve individuals receiving both an old age pension and a survivors pension because disability pensions paid to those above the legal or standard retirement age are in principle recorded as old age pensions Figure 3 classifies pensions at a first level according to four main ESSPROS functions namely disability old age survivors and unemployment Of these pensions relating to old age were in 2018 by far the largest category across the EU 27 accounting for 79 1 % of total expenditure and 79 9 % of pension beneficiaries Survivors pensions were the second largest category accounting for 12 5 % of expenditure and 21 8 % of beneficiaries followed by disability pensions 8 1 % of expenditure and 10 9 % of beneficiaries and unemployment pensions 0 3 % of expenditure and 0 2 % of beneficiaries A more detailed analysis may be performed for seven different ESSPROS categories with the main heading broken down into old age pensions anticipated old age pensions and partial pensions while the disability function may be broken down into disability pensions and early retirement benefits paid due to reduced capacity to work Old age pensions excluding anticipated and partial pensions were by far the largest of the seven ESSPROS categories their share of total expenditure stood at 75 4 % across the EU 27 in 2018 while disability pensions accounted for 6 0 % of total expenditure  --https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/NLP4StatRef/ontology/hasURI-->  Health care activities (Probability: 0.019721928983926773)
