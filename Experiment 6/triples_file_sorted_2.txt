While the sum of the expenditure on the different types of pension is always equal to total expenditure this is not the case for beneficiaries as an individual can receive multiple pensions simultaneously which leads to double counting if the numbers of beneficiaries for each type of pension are added up Such cases typically involve individuals receiving both an old age pension and a survivors pension because disability pensions paid to those above the legal or standard retirement age are in principle recorded as old age pensions Figure 3 classifies pensions at a first level according to four main ESSPROS functions namely disability old age survivors and unemployment Of these pensions relating to old age were in 2018 by far the largest category across the EU 27 accounting for 79 1 % of total expenditure and 79 9 % of pension beneficiaries Survivors pensions were the second largest category accounting for 12 5 % of expenditure and 21 8 % of beneficiaries followed by disability pensions 8 1 % of expenditure and 10 9 % of beneficiaries and unemployment pensions 0 3 % of expenditure and 0 2 % of beneficiaries A more detailed analysis may be performed for seven different ESSPROS categories with the main heading broken down into old age pensions anticipated old age pensions and partial pensions while the disability function may be broken down into disability pensions and early retirement benefits paid due to reduced capacity to work Old age pensions excluding anticipated and partial pensions were by far the largest of the seven ESSPROS categories their share of total expenditure stood at 75 4 % across the EU 27 in 2018 while disability pensions accounted for 6 0 % of total expenditure  --https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/NLP4StatRef/ontology/remark-->  Health care activities (Probability: 0.05350527912378311)

It is possible to reason in terms of clusters of statistics only if the basis for the collection and processing of these statistics (classifications, statistical units, etc) is sufficiently harmonised to qualify for potential integration. In business or household statistics significant efficiency gains could be generated via clustering.Example(s)Examples are business statistics and households statistics where the statistical unit is the same (enterprise and household respectively), classifications used are identical (for instance, NACE and CPA for business statistics, ISCED and ISCO for household statistics).  --https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/NLP4StatRef/ontology/remark-->  1718 (Probability: 0.023535437881946564)

The EU 27 labour force is composed of persons who are in employment and those who are unemployed In 2009 the EU labour force or the total number of economically active persons that were in possession of an ICT education numbered slightly over 2 million persons this number rose to 2 8 million persons by 2019 see Figure 1 Of these some 2 6 million persons aged 15 74 in the EU were employed and in possession of an ICT education in 2019 by contrast there were 190 000 persons with an ICT education who were unemployed During the period 2009 2019 the unemployment rate for people with an ICT education increased due to the global financial and economic crisis in 2008 from 8 8 % in 2009 to a peak of 11 0 % in 2012 From 2012 the labour market for people with an ICT education started to expand resulting in a decrease in the unemployment rate for this group The growth in the number of employed persons with an ICT education was particularly rapid in 2016 when it rose by 8 3 % compared with the year before This was the highest employment growth rate since 2008 After a marked slowdown in the pace of growth in 2017 the share of employed persons with an ICT education recovered in 2018 but decreased again in 2019 still presenting the highest rate ever reached during the decade with 93 3% Relatively higher unemployment rates in southern EU Member States for persons with an ICT education While there was an overall increase between 2009 and 2019 in the size of the EU labour force with an ICT education there were varied developments across the EU Member States In 2019 the share of the labour force with an ICT education who were in employment as opposed to being unemployed was 93 3 % or higher in Latvia with the highest rate of 99 2 % Bulgaria and Czechia By contrast a relatively high share of persons with an ICT education were unemployed in 2019 in Finland 7 9 % as well as in four southern Member States Portugal 9 5 % Spain 13 9 % Italy 14 0 % and most notably Greece which had the highest rate at 20 6 % A comparison between 2009 and 2019 based on the share of the labour force with an ICT education who were in employment reveals there was little overall change in the situation at EU level Some 91 2 % of the EU labour force with an ICT education were employed in 2009 while a decade later this share was 2 1 percentage points higher at 93 3 % in 2019 Between 2009 and 2019 the share of the labour force with an ICT education that was employed rose by 15 2 percentage points in Latvia to 99 2 % by 8 9 points in Lithuania to 98 1 % by 8 6 points in Romania to 96 9 % by 5 6 points in Poland to 97 2 % and by 5 4 points in Ireland to 93 4 % see Figure 3 By contrast reductions 4 8 percentage points were recorded in Greece where the share of those employed fell to 79 4 % in Italy 3 2 points 86 0 % and Spain 2 points 86 1 % and in Slovenia 0 3 points 95 7 % Among the non EU countries the most notable progression is recorded in Serbia with 26 7 percentage points between 2010 and 2019 from 61 4 % to 88 1 %  --https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/NLP4StatRef/ontology/remark-->  https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=International_trade_in_goods (Probability: 0.019968977198004723)

via the Eurostat website are compiled from COMEXT data according to a monthly process Data are collected by the competent national authorities of the Member States and compiled according to a harmonised methodology established by EU regulations before transmission to Eurostat For trade the statistical information is mainly provided by the traders on the basis of customs declarations EU
