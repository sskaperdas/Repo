The EU 27 labour force is composed of persons who are in employment and those who are unemployed In 2009 the EU labour force or the total number of economically active persons that were in possession of an ICT education numbered slightly over 2 million persons this number rose to 2 8 million persons by 2019 see Figure 1 Of these some 2 6 million persons aged 15 74 in the EU were employed and in possession of an ICT education in 2019 by contrast there were 190 000 persons with an ICT education who were unemployed During the period 2009 2019 the unemployment rate for people with an ICT education increased due to the global financial and economic crisis in 2008 from 8 8 % in 2009 to a peak of 11 0 % in 2012 From 2012 the labour market for people with an ICT education started to expand resulting in a decrease in the unemployment rate for this group The growth in the number of employed persons with an ICT education was particularly rapid in 2016 when it rose by 8 3 % compared with the year before This was the highest employment growth rate since 2008 After a marked slowdown in the pace of growth in 2017 the share of employed persons with an ICT education recovered in 2018 but decreased again in 2019 still presenting the highest rate ever reached during the decade with 93 3% Relatively higher unemployment rates in southern EU Member States for persons with an ICT education While there was an overall increase between 2009 and 2019 in the size of the EU labour force with an ICT education there were varied developments across the EU Member States In 2019 the share of the labour force with an ICT education who were in employment as opposed to being unemployed was 93 3 % or higher in Latvia with the highest rate of 99 2 % Bulgaria and Czechia By contrast a relatively high share of persons with an ICT education were unemployed in 2019 in Finland 7 9 % as well as in four southern Member States Portugal 9 5 % Spain 13 9 % Italy 14 0 % and most notably Greece which had the highest rate at 20 6 % A comparison between 2009 and 2019 based on the share of the labour force with an ICT education who were in employment reveals there was little overall change in the situation at EU level Some 91 2 % of the EU labour force with an ICT education were employed in 2009 while a decade later this share was 2 1 percentage points higher at 93 3 % in 2019 Between 2009 and 2019 the share of the labour force with an ICT education that was employed rose by 15 2 percentage points in Latvia to 99 2 % by 8 9 points in Lithuania to 98 1 % by 8 6 points in Romania to 96 9 % by 5 6 points in Poland to 97 2 % and by 5 4 points in Ireland to 93 4 % see Figure 3 By contrast reductions 4 8 percentage points were recorded in Greece where the share of those employed fell to 79 4 % in Italy 3 2 points 86 0 % and Spain 2 points 86 1 % and in Slovenia 0 3 points 95 7 % Among the non EU countries the most notable progression is recorded in Serbia with 26 7 percentage points between 2010 and 2019 from 61 4 % to 88 1 %  --https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/NLP4StatRef/ontology/hasReference-->  https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=International_trade_in_goods (Probability: 0.47825852036476135)

Multiple data sources High tech statistics uses various other domains and sources mainly within Eurostat s official statistics The coverage and availability of high tech statistics are then dependent on these other primary sources Trade in high tech products EU data is taken from Eurostat s COMEXT database COMEXT is the reference database for international trade in goods It provides access not only to both recent and historical data from the EU Member States but also to statistics of a significant number of third countries International trade aggregated and detailed statistics disseminated via the Eurostat website are compiled from COMEXT data according to a monthly process Data are collected by the competent national authorities of the Member States and compiled according to a harmonised methodology established by EU regulations before transmission to Eurostat For trade the statistical information is mainly provided by the traders on the basis of customs declarations EU data are compiled according to Community guidelines and may therefore differ from national data published by the Member States Statistics on trade are calculated as the sum of trade of each of the 27 EU Member States with countries outside the EU In other words the EU is considered as a single trading entity and trade flows are measured into and out of the area but not within it The United Kingdom is considered as an partner country for the EU for the whole period covered by this article However the United Kingdom was still part of the internal market until the end of the transitory period 31 December 2020 meaning that data on trade with the United Kingdom are still based on statistical concepts applicable to trade between the EU Member States Consequently while imports from any other trade partner are grouped by country of origin the United Kingdom data reflect the country of consignment In practice this means that the goods imported by the EU from the United Kingdom were physically transported from the United Kingdom but part of these goods could have been of other origin than the United Kingdom For this reason data on trade with the United Kingdom are not fully comparable with data on trade with other trade partners The product approach is used for data on high tech trade The product list is based on the calculations of R D intensity by groups of products R D expenditure total sales The groups classified as high technology products are aggregated on the basis of the Standard international trade classification SITC Due to the revision of SITC from SITC Rev 3 to SITC Rev 4 the definition of high tech products also changed in 2011 The data in this article use the high tech aggregation by SITC Rev 4 This list based on the OECD definition contains technical products of which the manufacturing involved a high intensity of R D Production of high tech products Industrial production data comes from PRODCOM Prodcom provides statistics on the production of manufactured goods The Prodcom data includes The Prodcom data is obtained by the National Statistical Institutes NSIs who conduct a survey of enterprises Eurostat calculates EU totals at

Price indices are compiled using the prices of these homogenous components A representative construction or number of projects is also chosen However the actual work entailed in its completion is broken down into precisely defined standard services or components A number of representative construction firms that have recently performed any of these services are surveyed to determine the price they have actually agreed or invoiced for these services A price index is then created for each standard component These indices are then aggregated for the buildings initially defined as the benchmarks The actual buildings are used only to define a selection of services and the corresponding weights A variant of this approach involves the re specification of a number of the representative projects on a cyclical basis The difference between an index based on input factors and one based on standard components is essentially one of degree since components are only factors at a more advanced stage of production However the standard component cost index also incorporates productivity gains and changes in profit margins as it reflects not only the cost of the factors but also the price of the finished product paid by the customers of the construction firm It will therefore include more of the price elements listed above that determine the prices of finished construction work Another advantage of this method is that the prices obtained are for components which remain comparable over time Fluctuations due to differential quality or execution are eliminated However while components are more homogeneous than completed buildings it is unlikely that they will be completely identical for different completed buildings If there is a permanent change in the way a component is performed its definition is changed and the new price series is spliced to the old one by means of chaining taking account of changes in quality Selecting truly representative standard components and determining weighting coefficients that accurately reflect construction techniques and the way buildings etc are usually constructed during the base year is the hardest and most important part of compiling the index However every standard component does not have to be priced separately For example if the price change characteristics of brick laying and paving are similar then prices of only one of similar standard components need to be incorporated in the construction price index An advantage of both the standard factor and standard component cost methods is that they can produce different indices merely by changing the weighting of the indices for each component For example indices could be compiled by type of work by trade or as in the example of the conventional construction price indices compiled in Germany by type of building  --https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/NLP4StatRef/ontology/hasCode-->  https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/NLP4StatRef/knowledge/hlth_co_inpstm (Probability: 0.39057087898254395)

While the sum of the expenditure on the different types of pension is always equal to total expenditure this is not the case for beneficiaries as an individual can receive multiple pensions simultaneously which leads to double counting if the numbers of beneficiaries for each type of pension are added up Such cases typically involve individuals receiving both an old age pension and a survivors pension because disability pensions paid to those above the legal or standard retirement age are in principle recorded as old age pensions Figure 3 classifies pensions at a first level according to four main ESSPROS functions namely disability old age survivors and unemployment Of these pensions relating to old age were in 2018 by far the largest category across the EU 27 accounting for 79 1 % of total expenditure and 79 9 % of pension beneficiaries Survivors pensions were the second largest category accounting for 12 5 % of expenditure and 21 8 % of beneficiaries followed by disability pensions 8 1 % of expenditure and 10 9 % of beneficiaries and unemployment pensions 0 3 % of expenditure and 0 2 % of beneficiaries A more detailed analysis may be performed for seven different ESSPROS categories with the main heading broken down into old age pensions anticipated old age pensions and partial pensions while the disability function may be broken down into disability pensions and early retirement benefits paid due to reduced capacity to work Old age pensions excluding anticipated and partial pensions were by far the largest of the seven ESSPROS categories their share of total expenditure stood at 75 4 % across the EU 27 in 2018 while disability pensions accounted for 6 0 % of total expenditure  --https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/NLP4StatRef/ontology/hasReference-->  Health care activities (Probability: 0.17807435989379883)
