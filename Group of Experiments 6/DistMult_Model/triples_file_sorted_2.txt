calculated as the sum of trade of each of the 27 EU Member States with countries outside the EU In other words the EU is considered as a single trading entity and trade flows are measured into and out of the area but not within it The United Kingdom is considered as an partner country for the EU for the whole period covered by this article However the United Kingdom was still part of the internal market until the end of the transitory period 31 December 2020 meaning that data on trade with the United Kingdom are still based on statistical concepts applicable to trade between the EU Member States Consequently while imports from any other trade partner are grouped by country of origin the United Kingdom data reflect the country of consignment In practice this means that the goods imported by the EU from the United Kingdom were physically transported from the United Kingdom but part of these goods could have been of other origin than the United Kingdom For this reason data on

It is possible to reason in terms of clusters of statistics only if the basis for the collection and processing of these statistics (classifications, statistical units, etc) is sufficiently harmonised to qualify for potential integration. In business or household statistics significant efficiency gains could be generated via clustering.Example(s)Examples are business statistics and households statistics where the statistical unit is the same (enterprise and household respectively), classifications used are identical (for instance, NACE and CPA for business statistics, ISCED and ISCO for household statistics).  --https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/NLP4StatRef/ontology/fileLink-->  1718 (Probability: 0.75285404920578)

Price indices are compiled using the prices of these homogenous components A representative construction or number of projects is also chosen However the actual work entailed in its completion is broken down into precisely defined standard services or components A number of representative construction firms that have recently performed any of these services are surveyed to determine the price they have actually agreed or invoiced for these services A price index is then created for each standard component These indices are then aggregated for the buildings initially defined as the benchmarks The actual buildings are used only to define a selection of services and the corresponding weights A variant of this approach involves the re specification of a number of the representative projects on a cyclical basis The difference between an index based on input factors and one based on standard components is essentially one of degree since components are only factors at a more advanced stage of production However the standard component cost index also incorporates productivity gains and changes in profit margins as it reflects not only the cost of the factors but also the price of the finished product paid by the customers of the construction firm It will therefore include more of the price elements listed above that determine the prices of finished construction work Another advantage of this method is that the prices obtained are for components which remain comparable over time Fluctuations due to differential quality or execution are eliminated However while components are more homogeneous than completed buildings it is unlikely that they will be completely identical for different completed buildings If there is a permanent change in the way a component is performed its definition is changed and the new price series is spliced to the old one by means of chaining taking account of changes in quality Selecting truly representative standard components and determining weighting coefficients that accurately reflect construction techniques and the way buildings etc are usually constructed during the base year is the hardest and most important part of compiling the index However every standard component does not have to be priced separately For example if the price change characteristics of brick laying and paving are similar then prices of only one of similar standard components need to be incorporated in the construction price index An advantage of both the standard factor and standard component cost methods is that they can produce different indices merely by changing the weighting of the indices for each component For example indices could be compiled by type of work by trade or as in the example of the conventional construction price indices compiled in Germany by type of building  --https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/NLP4StatRef/ontology/fileLink-->  https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/NLP4StatRef/knowledge/hlth_co_inpstm (Probability: 0.7323423027992249)

While the sum of the expenditure on the different types of pension is always equal to total expenditure this is not the case for beneficiaries as an individual can receive multiple pensions simultaneously which leads to double counting if the numbers of beneficiaries for each type of pension are added up Such cases typically involve individuals receiving both an old age pension and a survivors pension because disability pensions paid to those above the legal or standard retirement age are in principle recorded as old age pensions Figure 3 classifies pensions at a first level according to four main ESSPROS functions namely disability old age survivors and unemployment Of these pensions relating to old age were in 2018 by far the largest category across the EU 27 accounting for 79 1 % of total expenditure and 79 9 % of pension beneficiaries Survivors pensions were the second largest category accounting for 12 5 % of expenditure and 21 8 % of beneficiaries followed by disability pensions 8 1 % of expenditure and 10 9 % of beneficiaries and unemployment pensions 0 3 % of expenditure and 0 2 % of beneficiaries A more detailed analysis may be performed for seven different ESSPROS categories with the main heading broken down into old age pensions anticipated old age pensions and partial pensions while the disability function may be broken down into disability pensions and early retirement benefits paid due to reduced capacity to work Old age pensions excluding anticipated and partial pensions were by far the largest of the seven ESSPROS categories their share of total expenditure stood at 75 4 % across the EU 27 in 2018 while disability pensions accounted for 6 0 % of total expenditure  --https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/NLP4StatRef/ontology/fileLink-->  Health care activities (Probability: 0.6563115119934082)
