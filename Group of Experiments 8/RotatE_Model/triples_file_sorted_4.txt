--http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type-->  Historically human activity was generally assumed to have had little lasting impact on the land or the environment as many people held a common belief that nature could restore or replenish itself However land has become a natural and economic resource used for multiple purposes agriculture and forestry mining manufacturing and construction distributive trades transport and other services as well as for residential and leisure use The effects of certain phenomena rising temperatures the rapid disappearance of vast areas of forest the gradual desertification of certain regions or the rapid development of urban areas along coastlines have contributed towards increasing awareness and recognition that land is a finite resource and its use constitutes one of the principal drivers of environmental change with potential impacts on the climate ecosystems biodiversity and the overall quality of life The European Environment Agency EEA coordinates and integrates national databases on land cover into the Corine land cover CLC inventory Through the visual interpretation of high resolution satellite images it produces an inventory of land cover enabling various biophysical categories to be distinguished artificial areas agricultural areas forests and semi natural areas wetland and water bodies By analysing changes in these features it is possible to support a broad range of environmental policy developments such as climate change mitigation the conservation of biodiversity agricultural or forest management spatial planning or the effects of soil sealing Map 1 presents data on land cover for 2018 Information is shown at a very fine level of detail based on a matrix of 1 km grid cells that overlay the EU territory A high proportion of the EU s territory is used in an intensive form for artificial land cover urban settlements industry and commercial units or infrastructure This is particularly true in some of the most densely populated parts of the EU for example Malta or an area covering much of Belgium the Netherlands and north west Germany By contrast forests and semi natural areas including moors heathlands bare rock glaciers and perpetual snow were more prevalent in sparsely populated areas of the EU for example the northern halves of Finland and Sweden or mountainous areas such as the Alps the Pyrenees or the Carpathians Water covered a relatively low proportion of the total area of most EU Member States particularly in southern parts of the EU The main exceptions were Finland Sweden and the Netherlands The vast majority of the water cover in the Netherlands was composed of coastal wetlands whereas there are several hundred thousand natural lakes across Finland and Sweden Forest cover Forests are an essential part of the natural environment providing habitats for a wide range of animal and plant life One of the most important environmental roles that forests can play is to absorb carbon dioxide that would otherwise be in the atmosphere thereby helping to mitigate climate change Forests may also help protect landscapes against extreme weather events such as floods or droughts or related phenomena such as erosion Contrary to much of the rest of the world forest cover in the EU has increased gradually in recent years According to the EEA some 157 million hectares or 38 % of the EU 27 s land surface was covered by forests in 2018 In absolute terms the largest areas of forest cover were in Sweden 26 5 million hectares Finland 21 5 million hectares and France 14 4 million hectares In relative terms the highest proportions of forest tree cover were recorded in Finland 64 % Sweden 59 % and Slovenia 56 % these were the only Member States to report that more than half of their land was covered by forests By contrast less than one tenth of the land surface areas of Denmark 9 % the Netherlands 8 % and Malta 1 % were covered by forests Ecologically the EU is one of the most forest rich areas of the world with great diversity in terms of different forest types ranging from bogs and floodplain forests to boreal and alpine forests In Nordic EU Member States and mountainous areas coniferous forests predominate they are typically composed of tall trees in dense stands with little vegetation growing beneath the forest canopy By contrast broad leaved and mixed forests cover much of mainland Europe to the north of the Alps Southern Member States tend to have lower levels of forest cover or transitional woodland shrubland and those forests that do exist tend to be characterised by trees that are less tall and less densely set with more vegetation under the canopy Note that while the information for land cover and forest cover as presented in Maps 1 and 2 is shown for 1 km grid cells the remainder of the data presented in this article are shown at a more aggregated regional level using the NUTS classification Almost three quarters of the total land area of Corse France Mellersta Norrland Sweden and Pohjois ja It Suomi Finland was covered by forest and other wooded land As noted above the Corine land cover inventory is based on satellite images such images can only be used to register forest cover if there are trees present Field surveys allow for land that is temporarily unstocked for example due to harvesting fire or other natural disturbances to continue to be classified as forest or other wooded land Eurostat conducts a Land Use and Cover Area frame Survey LUCAS every three years The survey is carried out in situ meaning that observations are made and registered on the ground by field surveyors who classify land cover land use and landscape features while also taking a number of soil samples Figure 1 shows regional information for the EU regions with the largest areas and highest proportions of forest area and other wooded land This information is based on harmonised definitions provided by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation FAO whereby forests are defined as lands of more than 0 5 hectares which are not primarily under agricultural or urban land use with a tree canopy cover of more than 10 % and where trees should be able to reach at least 5 metres in height Other wooded land is defined as that with a tree canopy cover of 5 10 % or a canopy cover of more than 10 % when smaller trees shrubs and bushes are included Note that this definition is somewhat broader than that used in Map 1 Based on the above definitions the EU 27 had 176 million hectares of forests and other wooded land in 2015 this corresponded to 42 6 % of its land area In absolute terms and across NUTS level 2 regions the largest areas of forest and other wooded land were recorded in Pohjois ja It Suomi Finland and vre Norrland Sweden at 16 8 and 11 0 million hectares respectively The 10 regions with the largest areas of forest and other wooded land as shown in Figure 1 had a cumulative share of approximately one third of the EU 27 s total area of forest and other wooded land In 2015 almost three quarters of the land area of Corse France Mellersta Norrland Sweden and Pohjois ja It Suomi was covered by forest and other wooded land These were the highest shares recorded among NUTS level 2 regions while land Finland Norra Mellansverige Sweden and Liguria Italy also recorded shares of more than 70 0 % At the other end of the range there were 15 regions in the EU 27 where the share of forest area and other wooded land was in single digits These were principally located in the Netherlands and Vlaams Gewest the northern half of Belgium with the lowest shares in Prov West Vlaanderen Belgium Zeeland and Groningen both the Netherlands 2012 data for the latter (Probability:

oecd health data 2007 statistics and indicators for 30 countries oecd paris 2007 data sources definitions and methods  --https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/NLP4StatRef/ontology/hasReference-->  As noted under Policy Context policymakers are increasingly concerned with finding ways to encourage social participation and integration especially among marginalised groups This section provides information in relation to the support networks and other social contacts of European citizens Having someone for help or to discuss personal matters In 2015 5 9 % of the EU 28 population did not have any relative friend or neighbour who they could ask for help Men elderly people people with a low level of educational attainment people with low incomes and people living in urban areas were more likely not to have someone to ask for help see Figure 11 In 2015 some 6 0 % of the EU 28 adult population did not have someone with whom to discuss personal matters Once again men elderly people people with a low level of educational attainment people with low incomes and people living in urban areas were more likely not to have someone with whom to discuss personal matters see Figure 12 Almost 1 in 10 Europeans with a low level of educational attainment did not have someone to ask for help Figure 13 presents an analysis of the share of people who did not have someone to ask for help by educational attainment In 2015 almost 1 in 10 9 1 % adults aged 16 and over in the EU 28 with a low level of educational attainment found themselves in this position while corresponding shares for those people with a medium 5 0 % or high 3 5 % level of educational attainment were considerably lower Among the EU Member States the share of the adult population in 2015 that did not have someone to ask for help ranged from highs of 13 2 % in Italy and 12 9 % in Luxembourg the only Member States to record double digit shares down to less than 3 0 % in Hungary Sweden Slovakia the Czech Republic and Finland Generally people with lower levels of educational attainment were more likely not to have someone to ask for help while people with a high level of educational attainment were least likely not to have someone to ask for help The United Kingdom was the only EU Member State where this pattern was not followed as the lowest share of people who did not have someone to ask for help was recorded for people with a medium level of educational attainment Almost 1 in 10 elderly Europeans aged 75 and over did not have someone with whom to discuss personal matters In 2015 6 0 % of the EU 28 adult population did not have someone with whom to discuss personal matters There were quite large differences between the generations The share of the EU 28 population aged 75 and over that did not have someone with whom to discuss personal matters rose to 9 2 % in 2015 this could be contrasted with a 2 7 % share among people aged 16 24 years In 10 of the EU Member States the share of people aged 75 and over that did not have someone with whom to discuss personal matters rose into double digits the highest shares were recorded in the Netherlands 14 0 % Italy 14 2 % and particularly France 20 6 % see Figure 14 France also recorded the largest inter generational difference as the share of its population aged 75 and over that did not have someone with whom to discuss personal matters was 17 4 percentage points higher than the corresponding share recorded among young adults 16 24 years There were also considerable inter generational differences more than 10 0 percentage points between these two subpopulations in the three Baltic Member States the Netherlands and Finland In 2015 the share of the EU 28 adult population not having someone with whom to discuss personal matters peaked at 9 5 % for the first income quintile the bottom 20 % of the population with the lowest incomes This share consistently fell as income levels rose and reached a low of 3 7 % among the fifth income quintile the top 20 % of the population with the highest incomes see Figure 15 In most of the EU Member States the highest share of the population not having someone with whom to discuss personal matters was recorded among the bottom income quintile in 2015 the only exceptions to this pattern were Denmark where the share of the second income quintile was slightly higher and Spain where the first and second income quintiles had identical shares Social contact with friends and family Social interactions affect people s quality of life the satisfaction that people derive from being with family friends or colleagues impacts on their subjective well being and may act as a buffer against the negative effects of stress This section analyses the frequency with which Europeans get together and communicate with family and friends In 2015 more than half 51 9 % of the EU 28 population aged 16 and over got together at least once a week with family and relatives in its widest meaning A similar share 53 2 % of the EU 28 population got together with friends at least once a week These overall figures hide some interesting differences for example men in the EU 28 were more likely to get together at least once a week with friends 54 6 % in 2015 than with family and relatives 48 8 % while a higher proportion of women in the EU 28 got together with family and relatives 54 6 % compared with friends 51 8 % In 2015 more than four fifths 80 6 % of all young adults aged 16 24 years in the EU 28 got together with friends at least once a week this share was considerably higher than for any other age group By contrast some 56 1 % of elderly people aged 75 and over got together at least once a week with family and relatives this was the highest share among any of the age groups shown in Figure 16 The frequency with which a respondent is usually in contact with family and relatives or with friends relates to any form of contact made by telephone SMS the Internet e mail Skype Facebook FaceTime or other social networks and communication tools letter or fax note that the information presented should be based on a conversation and therefore excludes sharing and viewing information on social media if there is no other form of interaction In 2015 just over two thirds of the EU 28 adult population had contact at least once a week with their family and relatives 68 7 % the corresponding share for people having contact at least once a week with their friends was slightly lower 63 8 % Almost three quarters 73 2 % of women had contact at least once a week with family and relatives which was 9 6 percentage points higher than the corresponding share for men 63 6 % The gap between the sexes was much smaller when considering contact at least once a week with friends 65 0 % for women compared with 62 3 % for men In 2015 the share of the EU 28 adult population that had contact at least once a week with their family and relatives or with their friends was higher among those subpopulations with higher levels of educational attainment or income and those people who were living in cities However there was much more variation when analysing the results by age as the share of young adults aged 16 24 years in the EU 28 who had contact at least once a week with their friends reached almost 9 out 10 89 5 % and then fell rapidly for older age groups by contrast the share of the EU 28 population who had contact at least once a week with their family or relatives was relatively constant across the different age groups see Figure 17 1 in 6 adults in the EU 28 got together with family and relatives every day On average most people in the EU 28 got together with their family and relatives on a fairly regular basis In 2015 more than one third 35 2 % of the EU 28 adult population met up with their family and relatives at least once a week excluding every day while a slightly lower share 33 1 % met up with their family and relatives less than once a week but at least once a month see Figure 18 In 2015 one sixth 16 7 % of the EU 28 adult population reported that they got together with family and relatives every day note that the figures exclude those family members and relatives who share the same dwelling Among the EU Member States the share of the adult population getting together with family and relatives every day rose to around one third in Portugal Malta Greece and Slovakia and peaked at 45 4 % in Cyprus note a much higher share was recorded in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 85 8 % At the other end of the range some 15 1 % of the EU 28 adult population in 2015 reported getting together with family and relatives less than once a month including not at all these figures may be influenced by the considerable distances that divide some families as an increasing share of the EU 28 population relocates for work or retirement More than one fifth of the adult populations of the three Baltic Member States and Luxembourg got together less than once a month with their family and relatives the highest share being recorded in Latvia 24 8 % while more than one quarter of the adult population in the EU 28 got together with friends on a daily basis Figure 19 shows a similar set of information relating to the frequency with which people in the EU 28 got together with their friends In 2015 more than one third 36 8 % of the EU 28 adult population reported getting together with friends at least once every week but not every day while similar shares met friends every day 26 9 % or less than once a week but at least once a month 26 8 % as such less than one tenth 9 4 % of EU 28 adult population got together with their friends less than once a month or not at all In 2015 Cyprus Greece and Spain had the highest shares of their adult populations getting together with their friends on a daily basis each reported a share that was higher than two fifths with a peaked of 48 4 % in Cyprus These shares were synonymous with a more general pattern insofar as most of the southern EU Member States recorded relatively high shares of their adult populations having daily contact with friends Italy was the main exception whereas much lower shares of the adult populations in most eastern and Baltic Member States got together on a daily basis with their friends with a low of 9 7 % recorded in Poland Communication via social media Within the framework of the EU SILC 2015 ad hoc module on social and cultural participation and material deprivation respondents were asked about the frequency with which they communicated via social media including community based websites online discussions forums chat rooms and other social media spaces for example Facebook LinkedIn or Twitter Approximately half of the EU 28 adult population had not communicated via social media during the previous 12 months In 2015 just over half 50 5 % of the EU 28 adult population reported that they had not communicated via social media during the previous 12 months By contrast the second most popular response was recorded for those respondents who communicated using social media on a daily basis 26 2 % This contrasting situation may be largely explained by the age of respondents as almost two thirds 66 4 % of young adults 16 24 years used social media on a daily basis compared with just 6 8 % of the population aged 65 74 years and 2 2 % of the population aged 75 and over see Figure 20 Aside from young adults it was also the case that across the EU 28 in 2015 women people with a high level of educational attainment or income and people living in cities were more likely to communicate on a daily basis through social media Table 3 provides more detail in relation to the share of the adult population aged 16 and over that was communicating via social media in 2015 The share that used social media on a daily basis was higher than 40 0 % in Cyprus Denmark Sweden Ireland and Malta where a peak of 42 6 % was recorded By contrast close to three fifths of the adult population in Italy 59 6 % and Croatia 63 3 % had not communicated via social media during the 12 months prior to the survey A closer analysis of those people not communicating via social media during the 12 months prior to the survey in 2015 reveals a peak among young adults 16 24 years in Bulgaria and Romania where more than a fifth of this subpopulation had not used social media while Italy 13 3 % Hungary 10 4 % and France 10 3 % were the only other EU Member States where more than one tenth of all young adults had not communicated via social media during the previous 12 month period (Probability: 0.5606675148010254)

Self reported long standing limitations in usual activities due to health problems The data used in the article concerning self reported long standing limitations are derived from EU statistics on income and living conditions EU SILC This source is documented in more detail in this background article which provides information on the scope of the data its legal basis the methodology employed as well as related concepts and definitions The variables collected are used to assess the limitations people have experienced because of health problems in carrying out usual activities for at least six months the resulting measure is called the global activity limitation indicator GALI which is used as a proxy to measure disability and to calculate the healthy life years indicator GALI together with variables on self perceived health and chronic morbidity see the article on Self perceived health statistics constitute the minimum European health module The general coverage of EU SILC is all private households and their members who are residents at the time of data collection this therefore excludes people living in collective households Data refer to the population aged 16 years or over Functional and activity limitations and home care services The data concerning functional and activity limitations and on the use of come care services come from the European health interview survey EHIS This source is documented in more detail in this background article which provides information on the scope of the data its legal basis the methodology employed as well as related concepts and definitions The second wave of the EHIS was conducted in all EU Member States during 2013 2015 according to European Commission Regulation 141 2013 and its subsequent amendment to take account of the accession of Croatia to the EU European Commission Regulation 68 2014 The data presented here are the results for individual EU Member States from this second wave of the survey Physical and sensory functional limitations refer to the extent of the severity of at least one limitation self reported by the population aged 15 in what concerns vision hearing and walking Respondents evaluated the extent of their difficulties on the following scale no difficulty some difficulty in this article referred to as moderate difficulties a lot of difficulty and cannot do at all both referred to as severe difficulties Limitations in personal care activities show the severity of difficulties in at least one personal care activity covering feeding getting in and out of a bed or a chair dressing and undressing using a toilet bathing or showering based on the self reports of the population aged 65 and over Limitations in household activities show the severity of difficulties in at least one household activity covering preparing meals using the telephone shopping managing medication carrying out light housework carrying out occasional heavy housework taking care of finances and everyday administrative tasks based on the self reports of the population aged 65 and over It should be noted that there may be other than health reasons behind difficulties doing household activities The indicator on home care services shows the use of any type of home health and social care services It includes only formal care services provided by professional health or social workers not by family members or friends and refers to the past 12 months prior to the interview Limitations of the data All of the indicators presented in this article are derived from self reported data so they are to a certain extent affected by respondents subjective perception as well as by their social and cultural background EU SILC and the EHIS do not cover the institutionalised population for example people living in health and social care institutions who are more likely to face limitations than the population living in private households It is therefore likely that to some degree both of these data sources under estimate the share of the population facing limitations Furthermore the indicators presented are not age standardised and thus reflect the current national age structures Finally despite substantial and continuous efforts for harmonisation the implementation of EU SILC and EHIS is organised nationally which may impact on the results presented for example due to differences in the formulation of questions or their precise coverage Self reported long standing limitations in usual activities due to health problems The data used in the article concerning self reported long

Non profit institutions engaged in market production  --http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type-->  Statistical objectives Health accounts are increasingly expected to provide inputs along with other statistical information into improved analytical tools to monitor and assess health system performance One high priority is to develop reliable timely data that is comparable both across countries and over time This is indispensable for tracking trends in health spending and the factors driving it which can in turn be used to compare it across countries and to project how it will grow in the future Health accounts are thus used in two main ways internationally where the emphasis is on a selection of internationally comparable expenditure data and nationally with more detailed analyses of health care spending and a greater emphasis on comparisons over time Health accounts are crucial for both of these The system of health accounts SHA 2011 methodology reflects a desire to make health accounts more adaptable to rapidly evolving health systems around the world by further enhancing the cross country comparability of health expenditure and financing data and thereby increasing the information base for its analytical use Moreover it is hoped that the SHA 2011 will be more useful as a tool in the assessment and monitoring of health systems and in the analysis of the importance of health expenditures from a consumption perspective in the economy as a whole SHA 2011 is intended to constitute a system of comprehensive internally consistent and internationally comparable accounts which should be compatible with other aggregate economic and social statistics as far as possible Overall SHA 2011 has sought to adopt wherever appropriate definitions and concepts from existing statistical systems that have been approved and defined under the auspices of the United Nations and other international and regional organisations Being internally consistent makes it possible to use identities and accounting rules for cross checking the validity of estimates derived along the different dimensions of the SHA and to identify gaps and deficiencies in current reporting systems and health accounts thereby indicating priorities for the continued improvement of the data quality SHA 2011 provides a standard for classifying health expenditures according to the three axes of consumption provision and financing It gives guidance and methodological support in compiling health accounts More specifically the purposes of the SHA 2011 are to provide a framework of the main aggregates relevant to international comparisons of health expenditures and health systems analysis to provide a tool expandable by individual countries which can produce useful data in the monitoring and analysis of the health system to define internationally harmonised boundaries of health care for tracking expenditure on consumption In order to pursue these purposes SHA 2011 provides the basis for collecting cataloguing and estimating all the monetary flows related to health care expenditure Scope of the data Achieving consensus on a common boundary of health care activities is crucial for the complex task of international comparisons In pursuing this objective SHA refers to a functional approach based on selected health care activities that can be captured by transactions Transactions are valued activities that take place between different actors or organisations The transactions recorded in the SHA framework relate to health care goods and services provided and consumed to improve the health status of individuals and of the population as a whole It has to be emphasised that health itself is a condition and is therefore not exchangeable in contrast to health care Health has value in use and not in exchange Therefore in health accounts it is the demand supply and distribution of health care goods and services rather than health itself that define the transactions measured Coverage The functional classification of health care ICHA HC delineates the boundaries of health care activities from an international perspective Following the concept underlying the design of the ICHA HC classification the boundary contains all activities with the primary purpose of improving maintaining and preventing the deterioration of the health status of persons and mitigating the consequences of ill health through the application of qualified health knowledge medical paramedical and nursing knowledge including technology and traditional complementary and alternative medicine TCAM Current expenditure on healthcare covers the final consumption expenditure of resident units on healthcare goods and services including the healthcare goods and services provided directly to individual persons as well as collective healthcare services The current health care expenditure account of SHA focuses on final consumption and not on intermediate consumption of services and goods In other words SHA does not aim to account for health care goods and services provided as intermediate output to other providers An aspect to be considered in the consumption of health care is the non observed economy in other words unrecorded illegal or informal activities that are not always captured or reported in regular statistical sources SHA refers to valued transactions in other words transactions under which payments are made to providers in exchange for health care goods and services received by consumers In other words the flow of health care goods and services is accompanied by a flow of financial or other means In this context the health care boundary drawn in SHA includes personal home health services provided within households by family members in cases where they correspond to social transfer payments granted for this purpose This item therefore comprises private households as providers of home health care Unpaid care by household members is not included in the core health accounts of SHA Moreover SHA focuses on the consumption of health care goods and services by the resident population irrespective of where this takes place This implies the inclusion of imports from non resident providers and the exclusion of exports health care goods and services provided to non residents Finally SHA covers administration expenditure as administration is considered to be an embedded activity in the provision of health care goods and services such as the administrative activities carried out in a hospital or a physician s practice and for this reason it is included as an inherent part of the functional dimension (Probability: 0.5255990028381348)

Action 1 on average in 2014 one in eight schools had less school places than children who should be in education residing in a given district The largest proportion of such schools was recorded around Warsaw Conversely an excess of school places compared with the number of pupils was recorded for most schools with some having several times more places than school age children these were mostly in the north eastern and southern part of the Voivodship An apparently insufficient number of places for children residing in a school district does not mean that these school places were not available in fact a real insufficiency was recorded for only half the schools where the number of children residing in a given district exceeded the number of places A number of factors underlie this one of which is the fact that parents are not obliged to send their children to schools in districts where they reside A large proportion of schools have an excess number of places In many rural gminas municipalities the number of pupils per teacher was very low In extreme cases there were an average of 2 3 pupils per teacher with the average for all schools in the study being 11 pupils per teacher Closing schools in rural communities often results in pupils having to travel further to school in some gminas 90 % of children had to commute to schools and in one case the proportion was 100 % Concerning projections for 2020 the number of schools with insufficient places for children residing in school districts is expected to increase with the situation likely to be most severe in the central part of the Voivodship as well as in the north eastern gmina of yse in which the closure of four primary schools is expected to affect teaching conditions adversely Conversely the percentage of schools with an excess number of places is expected to increase mainly in southern parts of the Voivodship Pupil transport issues are likely to increase as more and more schools face closure Action 2 the original intention when looking at business concentration was to compare this with the concentration of a range of networks but in the end the only reliable and comprehensive comparison available was with the road network Areas of the two cities were identified which had above average business density and areas with above average density for road networks and these were mapped with various analyses for different types of businesses by legal form ownership form size and economic activity Overall there was little correlation between the location of businesses and the distribution of roads in either city although the mapping of the business data did show local variations depending on the different criteria used particularly in Bia ystok A further analysis was performed which identified where the higher density of businesses and the highest density of employment was in each of the two cities while these concentrations businesses and employment were relatively close to each other in both cities particularly in Toru they did not coincide exactly For accessibility by bus and train maps were plotted showing either the road or rail network accompanied by isolines representing accessibility index values These isolines ware not simply concentric circles around the city centres but were curved to reflect on one hand the location of major roads and rail lines and on the other hand the frequency of rail services at different times of the day Accessibility indices were plotted for the morning going into cities and for the afternoon evening leaving cities which also made it possible to contrast these two situations and thereby identify locations with relatively balanced or unbalanced accessibility in these two directions For the final analysis where road and rail networks were combined with information related to the travel time for each segment of these networks it was possible to identify the most efficient in terms of time routes between locations for example between areas outside of the city into the city centre When combining information for road and rail transport these identified the best of several nearby stations to drive to in order to take the train into the city in the shortest combined travelling time Action 3 no counterparts were found in the BDOT dataset for 68 objects 0 18 % of all identified objects in city centres 538 objects 0 45 % in suburban areas and 202 objects 0 54% in rural areas Equally various attributes were examined such as the number of storeys and the area and the proportion of errors was also regarded as low It was concluded that the dataset fulfils the criterion of usefulness for statistical purposes Having prepared a dataset for single family houses the information on the number of houses and their area were summarised within grid cells and the results presented as density indicators within a choropleth map  --https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/NLP4StatRef/ontology/term-->

Self reported long standing limitations in usual activities due to health problems The data used in the article concerning self reported long standing limitations are derived from EU statistics on income and living conditions EU SILC This source is documented in more detail in this background article which provides information on the scope of the data its legal basis the methodology employed as well as related concepts and definitions The variables collected are used to assess the limitations people have experienced because of health problems in carrying out usual activities for at least six months the resulting measure is called the global activity limitation indicator GALI which is used as a proxy to measure disability and to calculate the healthy life years indicator GALI together with variables on self perceived health and chronic morbidity see the article on Self perceived health statistics constitute the minimum European health module The general coverage of EU SILC is all private households and their members who are residents at the time of data collection this therefore excludes people living in collective households Data refer to the population aged 16 years or over Functional and activity limitations and home care services The data concerning functional and activity limitations and on the use of come care services come from the European health interview survey EHIS This source is documented in more detail in this background article which provides information on the scope of the data its legal basis the methodology employed as well as related concepts and definitions The second wave of the EHIS was conducted in all EU Member States during 2013 2015 according to European Commission Regulation 141 2013 and its subsequent amendment to take account of the accession of Croatia to the EU European Commission Regulation 68 2014 The data presented here are the results for individual EU Member States from this second wave of the survey Physical and sensory functional limitations refer to the extent of the severity of at least one limitation self reported by the population aged 15 in what concerns vision hearing and walking Respondents evaluated the extent of their difficulties on the following scale no difficulty some difficulty in this article referred to as moderate difficulties a lot of difficulty and cannot do at all both referred to as severe difficulties Limitations in personal care activities show the severity of difficulties in at least one personal care activity covering feeding getting in and out of a bed or a chair dressing and undressing using a toilet bathing or showering based on the self reports of the population aged 65 and over Limitations in household activities show the severity of difficulties in at least one household activity covering preparing meals using the telephone shopping managing medication carrying out light housework carrying out occasional heavy housework taking care of finances and everyday administrative tasks based on the self reports of the population aged 65 and over It should be noted that there may be other than health reasons behind difficulties doing household activities The indicator on home care services shows the use of any type of home health and social care services It includes only formal care services provided by professional health or social workers not by family members or friends and refers to the past 12 months prior to the interview Limitations of the data All of the indicators presented in this article are derived from self reported data so they are to a certain extent affected by respondents subjective perception as well as by their social and cultural background EU SILC and the EHIS do not cover the institutionalised population for example people living in health and social care institutions who are more likely to face limitations than the population living in private households It is therefore likely that to some degree both of these data sources under estimate the share of the population facing limitations Furthermore the indicators presented are not age standardised and thus reflect the current national age structures Finally despite

Relative poverty  --http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type-->  As noted under Policy Context policymakers are increasingly concerned with finding ways to encourage social participation and integration especially among marginalised groups This section provides information in relation to the support networks and other social contacts of European citizens Having someone for help or to discuss personal matters In 2015 5 9 % of the EU 28 population did not have any relative friend or neighbour who they could ask for help Men elderly people people with a low level of educational attainment people with low incomes and people living in urban areas were more likely not to have someone to ask for help see Figure 11 In 2015 some 6 0 % of the EU 28 adult population did not have someone with whom to discuss personal matters Once again men elderly people people with a low level of educational attainment people with low incomes and people living in urban areas were more likely not to have someone with whom to discuss personal matters see Figure 12 Almost 1 in 10 Europeans with a low level of educational attainment did not have someone to ask for help Figure 13 presents an analysis of the share of people who did not have someone to ask for help by educational attainment In 2015 almost 1 in 10 9 1 % adults aged 16 and over in the EU 28 with a low level of educational attainment found themselves in this position while corresponding shares for those people with a medium 5 0 % or high 3 5 % level of educational attainment were considerably lower Among the EU Member States the share of the adult population in 2015 that did not have someone to ask for help ranged from highs of 13 2 % in Italy and 12 9 % in Luxembourg the only Member States to record double digit shares down to less than 3 0 % in Hungary Sweden Slovakia the Czech Republic and Finland Generally people with lower levels of educational attainment were more likely not to have someone to ask for help while people with a high level of educational attainment were least likely not to have someone to ask for help The United Kingdom was the only EU Member State where this pattern was not followed as the lowest share of people who did not have someone to ask for help was recorded for people with a medium level of educational attainment Almost 1 in 10 elderly Europeans aged 75 and over did not have someone with whom to discuss personal matters In 2015 6 0 % of the EU 28 adult population did not have someone with whom to discuss personal matters There were quite large differences between the generations The share of the EU 28 population aged 75 and over that did not have someone with whom to discuss personal matters rose to 9 2 % in 2015 this could be contrasted with a 2 7 % share among people aged 16 24 years In 10 of the EU Member States the share of people aged 75 and over that did not have someone with whom to discuss personal matters rose into double digits the highest shares were recorded in the Netherlands 14 0 % Italy 14 2 % and particularly France 20 6 % see Figure 14 France also recorded the largest inter generational difference as the share of its population aged 75 and over that did not have someone with whom to discuss personal matters was 17 4 percentage points higher than the corresponding share recorded among young adults 16 24 years There were also considerable inter generational differences more than 10 0 percentage points between these two subpopulations in the three Baltic Member States the Netherlands and Finland In 2015 the share of the EU 28 adult population not having someone with whom to discuss personal matters peaked at 9 5 % for the first income quintile the bottom 20 % of the population with the lowest incomes This share consistently fell as income levels rose and reached a low of 3 7 % among the fifth income quintile the top 20 % of the population with the highest incomes see Figure 15 In most of the EU Member States the highest share of the population not having someone with whom to discuss personal matters was recorded among the bottom income quintile in 2015 the only exceptions to this pattern were Denmark where the share of the second income quintile was slightly higher and Spain where the first and second income quintiles had identical shares Social contact with friends and family Social interactions affect people s quality of life the satisfaction that people derive from being with family friends or colleagues impacts on their subjective well being and may act as a buffer against the negative effects of stress This section analyses the frequency with which Europeans get together and communicate with family and friends In 2015 more than half 51 9 % of the EU 28 population aged 16 and over got together at least once a week with family and relatives in its widest meaning A similar share 53 2 % of the EU 28 population got together with friends at least once a week These overall figures hide some interesting differences for example men in the EU 28 were more likely to get together at least once a week with friends 54 6 % in 2015 than with family and relatives 48 8 % while a higher proportion of women in the EU 28 got together with family and relatives 54 6 % compared with friends 51 8 % In 2015 more than four fifths 80 6 % of all young adults aged 16 24 years in the EU 28 got together with friends at least once a week this share was considerably higher than for any other age group By contrast some 56 1 % of elderly people aged 75 and over got together at least once a week with family and relatives this was the highest share among any of the age groups shown in Figure 16 The frequency with which a respondent is usually in contact with family and relatives or with friends relates to any form of contact made by telephone SMS the Internet e mail Skype Facebook FaceTime or other social networks and communication tools letter or fax note that the information presented should be based on a conversation and therefore excludes sharing and viewing information on social media if there is no other form of interaction In 2015 just over two thirds of the EU 28 adult population had contact at least once a week with their family and relatives 68 7 % the corresponding share for people having contact at least once a week with their friends was slightly lower 63 8 % Almost three quarters 73 2 % of women had contact at least once a week with family and relatives which was 9 6 percentage points higher than the corresponding share for men 63 6 % The gap between the sexes was much smaller when considering contact at least once a week with friends 65 0 % for women compared with 62 3 % for men In 2015 the share of the EU 28 adult population that had contact at least once a week with their family and relatives or with their friends was higher among those subpopulations with higher levels of educational attainment or income and those people who were living in cities However there was much more variation when analysing the results by age as the share of young adults aged 16 24 years in the EU 28 who had contact at least once a week with their friends reached almost 9 out 10 89 5 % and then fell rapidly for older age groups by contrast the share of the EU 28 population who had contact at least once a week with their family or relatives was relatively constant across the different age groups see Figure 17 1 in 6 adults in the EU 28 got together with family and relatives every day On average most people in the EU 28 got together with their family and relatives on a fairly regular basis In 2015 more than one third 35 2 % of the EU 28 adult population met up with their family and relatives at least once a week excluding every day while a slightly lower share 33 1 % met up with their family and relatives less than once a week but at least once a month see Figure 18 In 2015 one sixth 16 7 % of the EU 28 adult population reported that they got together with family and relatives every day note that the figures exclude those family members and relatives who share the same dwelling Among the EU Member States the share of the adult population getting together with family and relatives every day rose to around one third in Portugal Malta Greece and Slovakia and peaked at 45 4 % in Cyprus note a much higher share was recorded in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 85 8 % At the other end of the range some 15 1 % of the EU 28 adult population in 2015 reported getting together with family and relatives less than once a month including not at all these figures may be influenced by the considerable distances that divide some families as an increasing share of the EU 28 population relocates for work or retirement More than one fifth of the adult populations of the three Baltic Member States and Luxembourg got together less than once a month with their family and relatives the highest share being recorded in Latvia 24 8 % while more than one quarter of the adult population in the EU 28 got together with friends on a daily basis Figure 19 shows a similar set of information relating to the frequency with which people in the EU 28 got together with their friends In 2015 more than one third 36 8 % of the EU 28 adult population reported getting together with friends at least once every week but not every day while similar shares met friends every day 26 9 % or less than once a week but at least once a month 26 8 % as such less than one tenth 9 4 % of EU 28 adult population got together with their friends less than once a month or not at all In 2015 Cyprus Greece and Spain had the highest shares of their adult populations getting together with their friends on a daily basis each reported a share that was higher than two fifths with a peaked of 48 4 % in Cyprus These shares were synonymous with a more general pattern insofar as most of the southern EU Member States recorded relatively high shares of their adult populations having daily contact with friends Italy was the main exception whereas much lower shares of the adult populations in most eastern and Baltic Member States got together on a daily basis with their friends with a low of 9 7 % recorded in Poland Communication via social media Within the framework of the EU SILC 2015 ad hoc module on social and cultural participation and material deprivation respondents were asked about the frequency with which they communicated via social media including community based websites online discussions forums chat rooms and other social media spaces for example Facebook LinkedIn or Twitter Approximately half of the EU 28 adult population had not communicated via social media during the previous 12 months In 2015 just over half 50 5 % of the EU 28 adult population reported that they had not communicated via social media during the previous 12 months By contrast the second most popular response was recorded for those respondents who communicated using social media on a daily basis 26 2 % This contrasting situation may be largely explained by the age of respondents as almost two thirds 66 4 % of young adults 16 24 years used social media on a daily basis compared with just 6 8 % of the population aged 65 74 years and 2 2 % of the population aged 75 and over see Figure 20 Aside from young adults it was also the case that across the EU 28 in 2015 women people with a high level of educational attainment or income and people living in cities were more likely to communicate on a daily basis through social media Table 3 provides more detail in relation to the share of the adult population aged 16 and over that was communicating via social media in 2015 The share that used social media on a daily basis was higher than 40 0 % in Cyprus Denmark Sweden Ireland and Malta where a peak of 42 6 % was recorded By contrast close to three fifths of the adult population in Italy 59 6 % and Croatia 63 3 % had not communicated via social media during the 12 months prior to the survey A closer analysis of those people not communicating via social media during the 12 months prior to the survey in 2015 reveals a peak among young adults 16 24 years in Bulgaria and Romania where more than a fifth of this subpopulation had not used social media while Italy 13 3 % Hungary 10 4 % and France 10 3 % were the only other EU Member States where more than one tenth of all young adults had not communicated via social media during the previous 12 month period (Probability:
