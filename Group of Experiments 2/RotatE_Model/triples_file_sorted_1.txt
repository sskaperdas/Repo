http://schema.org/Dataset  --https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/NLP4StatRef/ontology/term-->  Historical developments Urban and rural developments are central concepts used by a wide range of policymakers researchers national administrations and international organisations While these terms may be readily understood by the general public a clear statistical definition at an international level has proved elusive The degree of urbanisation classification was originally introduced in 1991 distinguishing between densely intermediate and thinly populated areas It was based on information for numbers of inhabitants population density and the contiguity of local administrative units at level 2 LAU2 otherwise referred to as municipalities As LAU2s varied considerably in terms of their size area the results were compromised in terms of comparability this was especially the case for EU Member States characterised by relatively large or relatively small LAUs Note also that the original classification for the degree of urbanisation was based on different population density thresholds to those currently employed for example densely populated areas had a lower threshold of 500 inhabitants per km which led to many smaller towns and some suburbs being classified within this category In 2011 the OECD together with the European Commission s Directorates General for Regional and Urban Policy Eurostat Agriculture and Rural Development and the Joint Research Centre JRC started working on revising the degree of urbanisation classification As a result the methodology has been improved see A harmonised definition of cities and rural areas the new degree of urbanisation WP 01 2014 The refinement of the methodology also provided an opportunity to harmonise several similar but not identical spatial concepts Changes over time that impact on the classification The degree of urbanisation classification should be updated to reflect any changes to the underlying sources of information that are used in the compilation of this classification As such the classification may be updated to reflect changes to LAU boundaries or changes to population distributions for 1 km grid cells The frequency of such updates varies according to the source of information Changes to the degree of urbanisation classification resulting from a revision of population distributions for 1 km grid cells are less common and these may be expected every 10 years when new census data becomes available The next major update of the population grid is foreseen to take place for the 2021 reference year Annual updates of the degree of urbanisation classification should be made to reflect changes to LAU boundaries These modifications can be implemented in two ways applying the degree of urbanisation methodology as described above for the new layer of LAUs or estimating the degree of urbanisation based on changes to LAU boundaries The first approach is more labour intensive while the second is particularly suitable if boundary changes for LAUs are relatively small or consist principally of merging LAUs especially if these have the same degree of urbanisation Updating the degree of urbanisation to reflect changes in LAU boundaries LAU boundaries may change over time in three different ways LAUs can merge they may undergo a boundary shift or they may be split The most common change for LAUs within the EU in recent years has been for two or more units to be merged boundary shifts have been less common while splitting units apart has been rare Case 1 LAU mergers Merging two LAUs with different degrees of urbanisation may be resolved by giving precedence to the more densely populated unit when merging LAUs composed of a city and a town or suburb reclassify the new LAU as a city when merging LAUs composed of a town or suburb and a rural area reclassify the new LAU as a town or suburb Such a process may be further refined by taking into account the relative population sizes of the two LAUs Case 1a LAU mergers involving the same degree of urbanisation The degree of urbanisation is additive meaning that if two LAUs classified as thinly populated areas are subsequently merged into a single LAU then they will remain a thinly populated area this is also true for the other degrees of urbanisation Case 1b LAU mergers involving a densely populated area The degree or urbanisation methodology specifies that each high density cluster should have at least 75 % of its population covered by densely populated LAUs It also foresees a method to match densely populated areas with the geographic areas of administrative or political functions and links the degree of urbanisation to the city data collection exercise This means that any merger involving an LAU that has been previously classified as a densely populated area should result in the newly merged LAU also being classified as a densely populated area Case 1c LAU mergers involving thinly populated and intermediate density areas These mergers can be addressed in two simple ways using the population of the urban cluster or using the population of the LAUs In the first case if the population of the relevant urban cluster s is available then add the population inhabiting the urban cluster for each of the LAUs and divide this by the total population of the new LAU to determine the new degree of urbanisation If more than 50 % of the population of the new LAU lives in an urban cluster the new LAU should be classified as an intermediate density area If the population share is less than 50 % then the new LAU should be classified as a thinly populated area In the second case if the population living in the urban cluster cannot be identified then the degree of urbanisation may be determined based on the population distribution between the LAUs If more than 50 % of the population of the new LAU comes from thinly populated LAUs the new LAU should be classified as thinly populated If more than 50 % of the population of the new LAU comes from intermediate density LAUs the new LAU should be classified as intermediate density Case 2 LAU boundary shifts Whereas mergers can be dealt with using simple methods boundary shifts cannot always be as reliably addressed Indeed in some rare cases boundary shifts between LAUs that have the same degree of urbanisation can lead to a change in classification Such complexity means that a simple rule of thumb is often the preferred and most efficient approach A simple rule may be established whereby if an LAU loses less than 25 % of its previous population or gains less than 50 % of its population due to boundary shifts then the degree of urbanisation does not change This rule of thumb is likely to cover 90 % of all boundary shifts and ensures continuity If this is not the case then further investigation is required as described below Case 2a changes in the degree of urbanisation from boundary shifts are excluded For each LAU the share of population in the three different types of population grids cells is known For example if as the result of a boundary shift the population of an LAU that has 100 % of its population in rural grid cells shrinks then it will remain a thinly populated area Equally if a boundary shift for an LAU that has 100 % of its population in rural grid cells rises then the new LAU would need to more than double its population before it could potentially become an intermediate density area As a result if the boundary shift leads to a change in population that is too small to tip the population share of the revised LAU below 50 % of the relevant grid cells it keeps the same degree of urbanisation Case 2b changes in the degree of urbanisation from boundary shifts are unlikely but cannot be excluded If the boundary shift leads to a change in population that is theoretically sufficient to the tip the population share of the revised LAU below or above 50 % but the shift is between LAUs with the same degree of urbanisation then the same degree of urbanisation should be kept Case 2c changes in the degree of urbanisation from boundary shifts are likely In some cases changes in the degree of urbanisation are likely Take for example if a city were to gain part of a suburb as a result of a boundary shift The city a densely populated area gains a small number of additional inhabitants which does not have an impact on its degree of urbanisation The suburb loses some of its population that is reclassified to the city As a result the population in the revised LAU covered by the suburb may have less than 50 % of its population living in an urban cluster in which case it should subsequently be reclassified as a thinly populated area Case 3 splitting LAUs This type of change is relatively rare Therefore the main recommendation is one of continuity in other words maintain the same degree of urbanisation If an LAU is split the new LAUs should have the same degree of urbanisation as the old LAU If there are concerns that the new LAUs may have different urban structures the same approaches as described for boundary shifts can be used Future developments At the time of writing a 2021 population and housing census implementing regulation is in the process of being adopted by the European Commission It includes an article for 1 km population grid statistics as well as information for annual counts of populations it also foresees more detailed analyses including population by sex population by age number of employed persons population by place of birth population by usual place of residence one year prior to the census Eurostat are also discussing post 2021 census developments with national statistical authorities It is possible that from the mid 2020s onwards the ESS will agree to produce annual counts of populations based on usual place of residence for a 1 km grid with data to be made available within 12 months of the end of the reference period (Probability: 0.5056621432304382)

Figures 5 and 6 present the same composition of revenues as in Figure 4 but with information for the EU Member States for two examples namely pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical preparations hereafter referred to as pharmaceuticals and for audio visual services Note that the export data for the EU concern extra EU trade whereas for the Member States these data concern trade with the rest of the world Gross capital formation can be negative for example when stocks are run down or when disposals of fixed assets exceed investments in the same assets Compared with all industrial products pharmaceuticals were much less likely to be used as intermediate products or as gross capital formation and they were much more likely to be exported and somewhat more likely to be used for final consumption Among the EU Member States their export share in 2017 ranged from 10 8 % in Romania and 13 3 % in Slovakia to more than 50 % in the Netherlands and Germany 67 9 % in Denmark 71 1 % in Belgium and 72 9 % in Slovenia In 21 Member States out of 24 for which data are available pharmaceuticals were more likely to be used for final consumption than for intermediate consumption although the reverse was true in Belgium Slovenia and Denmark Gross capital formation from pharmaceutical products was generally quite low ranging from 0 6 % to 1 2 % of total use in most Member States with slightly higher shares in Greece 2 0 % Lithuania 2 5 % Romania 2 7 % and Croatia 2 8 % and much lower shares in Slovenia 22 2 % and Germany 25 6 % Compared with Figure 5 the analysis of the composition of revenues for audio visual services in Figure 6 is somewhat simpler as none of the EU Member States reported negative values for gross capital formation in 2017 Again the export share varied greatly between Member States with Luxembourg recording by far the highest value 66 4 % its share 2 6 times as high as that of Czechia 25 8 % which had the second highest share In 10 of the 24 Member States for which data are available including one of the largest ones Italy exports accounted for less than 10 0 % of the total use of audio visual services with this share below 5 0 % in Denmark Finland Croatia Slovakia and Romania The use of audio visual services for gross capital formation in 2017 was somewhat lower than the average for the whole economy at 7 4 % in the EU based on available data Latvia 26 1 % Spain 23 3 % and Slovakia 22 7 % reported relatively high gross capital formation shares for these products while Finland and Portugal recorded the next highest shares 16 4 % and 16 3 % respectively By contrast less than 5 0 % of revenues was used for gross capital formation in Cyprus Greece Austria Germany the Netherlands Luxembourg Sweden Poland and Croatia The division between intermediate and final consumption in 2017 was slightly less balanced for audio visual services than for the economy as a whole with intermediate consumption accounting for 47 4 % of all uses in the EU and final consumption for 32 5 % both shares are based on available data In France Romania and Hungary intermediate consumption of audio visual services was at least twice as high as final consumption while it was 3 8 times as high in Portugal 5 1 times as high in Sweden and peaked in Luxembourg at 19 3 times as high By contrast final consumption was greater than intermediate consumption in eight EU Member States with particularly high shares for final consumption relative to intermediate consumption in Slovakia 5 3 times as high and Lithuania 3 0 times as high  --https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/NLP4StatRef/ontology/level-->  http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/education-and-training/data/database (Probability: 0.32212382555007935)

Historical developments Urban and rural developments are central concepts used by a wide range of policymakers researchers national administrations and international organisations While these terms may be readily understood by the general public a clear statistical definition at an international level has proved elusive The degree of urbanisation classification was originally introduced in 1991 distinguishing between densely intermediate and thinly populated areas It was based on information for numbers of inhabitants population density and the contiguity of local administrative units at level 2 LAU2 otherwise referred to as municipalities As LAU2s varied considerably in terms of their size area the results were compromised in terms of comparability this was especially the case for EU Member States characterised by relatively large or relatively small LAUs Note also that the original classification for the degree of urbanisation was based on different population density thresholds to those currently employed for example densely populated areas had a lower threshold of 500 inhabitants per km which led to many smaller towns and some suburbs being classified within this category In 2011 the OECD together with the European Commission s Directorates General for Regional and Urban Policy Eurostat Agriculture and Rural Development and the Joint Research Centre JRC started working on revising the degree of urbanisation classification As a result the methodology has been improved see A harmonised definition of cities and rural areas the new degree of urbanisation WP 01 2014 The refinement of the methodology also provided an opportunity to harmonise several similar but not identical spatial concepts Changes over time that impact on the classification The degree of urbanisation classification should be updated to reflect any changes to the underlying sources of information that are used in the compilation of this classification As such the classification may be updated to reflect changes to LAU boundaries or changes to population distributions for 1 km grid cells The frequency of such updates varies according to the source of information Changes to the degree of urbanisation classification resulting from a revision of population distributions for 1 km grid cells are less common and these may be expected every 10 years when new census data becomes available The next major update of the population grid is foreseen to take place for the 2021 reference year Annual updates of the degree of urbanisation classification should be made to reflect changes to LAU boundaries These modifications can be implemented in two ways applying the degree of urbanisation methodology as described above for the new layer of LAUs or estimating the degree of urbanisation based on changes to LAU boundaries The first approach is more labour intensive while the second is particularly suitable if boundary changes for LAUs are relatively small or consist principally of merging LAUs especially if these have the same degree of urbanisation Updating the degree of urbanisation to reflect changes in LAU boundaries LAU boundaries may change over time in three different ways LAUs can merge they may undergo a boundary shift or they may be split The most common change for LAUs within the EU in recent years has been for two or more units to be merged boundary shifts have been less common while splitting units apart has been rare Case 1 LAU mergers Merging two LAUs with different degrees of urbanisation may be resolved by giving precedence to the more densely populated unit when merging LAUs composed of a city and a town or suburb reclassify the new LAU as a city when merging LAUs composed of a town or suburb and a rural area reclassify the new LAU as a town or suburb Such a process may be further refined by taking into account the relative population sizes of the two LAUs Case 1a LAU mergers involving the same degree of urbanisation The degree of urbanisation is additive meaning that if two LAUs classified as thinly populated areas are subsequently merged into a single LAU then they will remain a thinly populated area this is also true for the other degrees of urbanisation Case 1b LAU mergers involving a densely populated area The degree or urbanisation methodology specifies that each high density cluster should have at least 75 % of its population covered by densely populated LAUs It also foresees a method to match densely populated areas with the geographic areas of administrative or political functions and links the degree of urbanisation to the city data collection exercise This means that any merger involving an LAU that has been previously classified as a densely populated area should result in the newly merged LAU also being classified as a densely populated area Case 1c LAU mergers involving thinly populated and intermediate density areas These mergers can be addressed in two simple ways using the population of the urban cluster or using the population of the LAUs In the first case if the population of the relevant urban cluster s is available then add the population inhabiting the urban cluster for each of the LAUs and divide this by the total population of the new LAU to determine the new degree of urbanisation If more than 50 % of the population of the new LAU lives in an urban cluster the new LAU should be classified as an intermediate density area If the population share is less than 50 % then the new LAU should be classified as a thinly populated area In the second case if the population living in the urban cluster cannot be identified then the degree of urbanisation may be determined based on the population distribution between the LAUs If more than 50 % of the population of the new LAU comes from thinly populated LAUs the new LAU should be classified as thinly populated If more than 50 % of the population of the new LAU comes from intermediate density LAUs the new LAU should be classified as intermediate density Case 2 LAU boundary shifts Whereas mergers can be dealt with using simple methods boundary shifts cannot always be as reliably addressed Indeed in some rare cases boundary shifts between LAUs that have the same degree of urbanisation can lead to a change in classification Such complexity means that a simple rule of thumb is often the preferred and most efficient approach A simple rule may be established whereby if an LAU loses less than 25 % of its previous population or gains less than 50 % of its population due to boundary shifts then the degree of urbanisation does not change This rule of thumb is likely to cover 90 % of all boundary shifts and ensures continuity If this is not the case then further investigation is required as described below Case 2a changes in the degree of urbanisation from boundary shifts are excluded For each LAU the share of population in the three different types of population grids cells is known For example if as the result of a boundary shift the population of an LAU that has 100 % of its population in rural grid cells shrinks then it will remain a thinly populated area Equally if a boundary shift for an LAU that has 100 % of its population in rural grid cells rises then the new LAU would need to more than double its population before it could potentially become an intermediate density area As a result if the boundary shift leads to a change in population that is too small to tip the population share of the revised LAU below 50 % of the relevant grid cells it keeps the same degree of urbanisation Case 2b changes in the degree of urbanisation from boundary shifts are unlikely but cannot be excluded If the boundary shift leads to a change in population that is theoretically sufficient to the tip the population share of the revised LAU below or above 50 % but the shift is between LAUs with the same degree of urbanisation then the same degree of urbanisation should be kept Case 2c changes in the degree of urbanisation from boundary shifts are likely In some cases changes in the degree of urbanisation are likely Take for example if a city were to gain part of a suburb as a result of a boundary shift The city a densely populated area gains a small number of additional inhabitants which does not have an impact on its degree of urbanisation The suburb loses some of its population that is reclassified to the city As a result the population in the revised LAU covered by the suburb may have less than 50 % of its population living in an urban cluster in which case it should subsequently be reclassified as a thinly populated area Case 3 splitting LAUs This type of change is relatively rare Therefore the main recommendation is one of continuity in other words maintain the same degree of urbanisation If an LAU is split the new LAUs should have the same degree of urbanisation as the old LAU If there are concerns that the new LAUs may have different urban structures the same approaches as described for boundary shifts can be used Future developments At the time of writing a 2021 population and housing census implementing regulation is in the process of being adopted by the European Commission It includes an article for 1 km population grid statistics as well as information for annual counts of populations it also foresees more detailed analyses including population by sex population by age number of employed persons population by place of birth population by usual place of residence one year prior to the census Eurostat are also discussing post 2021 census developments with national statistical authorities It is possible that from the mid 2020s onwards the ESS will agree to produce annual counts of populations based on usual place of residence for a 1 km grid with data to be made available within 12 months of the end of the reference period  --https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/NLP4StatRef/ontology/term-->

Within the EU lung cancer accounted for one fifth of all deaths from cancer In 2016 nearly a quarter of a million 239 thousand people died from lung cancer in the EU 27 one fifth 20 5 % of all deaths from cancer and 5 3 % of the total number of deaths see Table 1 The share of all deaths attributed to lung cancer was 7 3 % among men more than double the share 3 3 % recorded for women Among the EU Member States the share of the total number of deaths from lung cancer peaked in 2017 in the Netherlands and Denmark both 7 0 % in contrast to shares of less than 3 5 % in Bulgaria and Lithuania both 3 1 % The high share of total deaths from lung cancer in the Netherlands reflected the fact that this country ranked second for men and third for women at 8 6 % of all male deaths and 5 5 % of all female deaths the share of deaths from lung cancer among men was higher in Greece 9 1 % and among women was higher in Denmark 6 8 % and Ireland 5 9 % In 2016 the EU 27 standardised death rate for lung cancer was 52 9 per 100 000 inhabitants higher than the rates for the three other types of cancer presented in this article An analysis by gender and by age shows large differences in the standardised death rates for lung cancer for men the rate was 83 6 per 100 000 inhabitants some 2 8 times as high as for women 29 5 per 100 000 inhabitants although there were signs of this gender gap narrowing in recent years As is typical for cancers as a whole the standardised death rate for lung cancer for persons aged 65 years and over 192 4 per 100 000 inhabitants was many times higher than it was for younger persons for persons aged less than 65 years the rate was 19 1 per 100 000 inhabitants Among the EU Member States by far the highest standardised death rate for lung cancer in 2017 was recorded in Hungary 89 2 per 100 000 inhabitants followed by Croatia Poland Denmark and the Netherlands with rates within the range of 63 68 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants Finland Sweden and Portugal were the only Member States to record standardised death rates for lung cancer that were below 40 0 per 100 000 inhabitants Sweden had by far the lowest standardised death rate among the Member States for males at 41 5 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants in 2017 compared with the next lowest death rate which was 60 3 per 100 000 inhabitants in Finland For females the lowest standardised death rates for lung cancer were recorded in Portugal Cyprus and Lithuania all below 16 0 per 100 000 inhabitants 536 thousand in patient discharges for lung cancer Based on available data for the EU Member States there were 536 thousand discharges of lung cancer in patients 2018 data except 2017 data for Germany and Malta 2016 data for Denmark and Luxembourg 2015 data for Portugal no recent data for Estonia or Greece From Figure 1 it can be seen that the highest discharge rate for in patients in 2018 was in Hungary where 262 in patients per 100 000 inhabitants were discharged after diagnosis or treatment for lung cancer In Germany 2017 data and Austria this rate was between 240 and 245 discharges per 100 000 inhabitants Elsewhere the rate ranged from 47 discharges per 100 000 inhabitants in Portugal 2015 data to 185 discharges per 100 000 inhabitants in Slovenia The average length of stay for lung cancer in patients was typically up to 3 0 days longer than for all in patients having been treated for neoplasms Among the EU Member States for which data are available see Figure 1 in 2018 the average length of stay for lung cancer in patients ranged from less than 5 0 days in the Netherlands and Bulgaria where the lowest average stay was recorded at 3 4 days to peaks of 12 0 days in Portugal 2015 data and 13 1 days in Malta 2017 data The average length of stay for lung cancer in patients was typically longer than the average for all in patients having been treated for neoplasms whether malignant cancer in situ or benign the difference reached 3 3 extra days in Finland 2 9 extra days in Belgium and Malta 2017 data 2 8 extra days in France and Croatia and 2 7 extra days in Czechia However in Cyprus Latvia Lithuania the Netherlands Slovenia Germany 2017 data and Bulgaria the average length of stay for lung cancer in patients was shorter than the average for all in patients having been treated for neoplasms  --https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/NLP4StatRef/ontology/term-->  Update of the SNA 1993 and revision of ESA95 (Probability: 0.00024991019745357335)
