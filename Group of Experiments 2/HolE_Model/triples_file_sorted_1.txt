Railway lines density is especially high in the regions of Germany Czechia Hungary the Netherlands Poland and Romania see Map 2 Unsurprisingly the highest rail density ratios are often observed in capital regions such as Berlin Praha Budapest and Bucure ti Ilfov where network nodes have developed Regional rail density is also driven by the presence of economic activities such as heavy industries or seaport infrastructures In general the density of railway lines is high in western and central parts of Europe and lower in the peripheral areas The highest network densities above 300 km 1 000 km 2 can be found in three regions in Germany one in Czechia and one in Hungary followed by 25 other regions in Czechia Poland Germany Romania France the Netherlands Slovakia Luxembourg and Hungary above 100 km 1 000 km 2 Looking at individual regions the densest railway networks are observed in two capital regions Berlin 698 km 1 000 km 2 and Praha 491 km 1 000 km 2 These regions are followed by Hamburg 395 km 1 000 km 2 Budapest 390 km 1 000 km 2 and Bremen 337 km 1 000 km 2 Hamburg and Bremen are two smaller NUTS 2 regions where extensive freight lines to and from seaports contribute to the high density Like the capital regions mentioned above Hamburg and Bremen are much smaller than regions such as Zuid Holland and Antwerpen These differences make it hard to draw direct comparisons with the infrastructure around other ports Freight transport railway lines also play a leading role in several regions where coal and steel industries remain predominant such as the Saarland region in western Germany 134 km 1 000 km 2 and l skie in southern Poland 156 km 1 000 km 2 Focusing on railway infrastructure at country level there are significant differences among countries with respect to the share of the network that is electrified Luxembourg 97 % Sweden 75 % the Netherlands 73 % Italy 72 % Bulgaria and Austria 71 % and Portugal 67 % registered the highest shares while Ireland and the Baltic States are the only Member States where less than 20 % of the network is electrified  --http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#versionInfo-->  An entity exists whether data about it are available or not (Probability: 0.8780924081802368)

--------------------------------------------------
Historical developments Urban and rural developments are central concepts used by a wide range of policymakers researchers national administrations and international organisations While these terms may be readily understood by the general public a clear statistical definition at an international level has proved elusive The degree of urbanisation classification was originally introduced in 1991 distinguishing between densely intermediate and thinly populated areas It was based on information for numbers of inhabitants population density and the contiguity of local administrative units at level 2 LAU2 otherwise referred to as municipalities As LAU2s varied considerably in terms of their size area the results were compromised in terms of comparability this was especially the case for EU Member States characterised by relatively large or relatively small LAUs Note also that the original classification for the degree of urbanisation was based on different population density thresholds to those currently employed for example densely populated areas had a lower threshold of 500 inhabitants per km which led to many smaller towns and some suburbs being classified within this category In 2011 the OECD together with the European Commission s Directorates General for Regional and Urban Policy Eurostat Agriculture and Rural Development and the Joint Research Centre JRC started working on revising the degree of urbanisation classification As a result the methodology has been improved see A harmonised definition of cities and rural areas the new degree of urbanisation WP 01 2014 The refinement of the methodology also provided an opportunity to harmonise several similar but not identical spatial concepts Changes over time that impact on the classification The degree of urbanisation classification should be updated to reflect any changes to the underlying sources of information that are used in the compilation of this classification As such the classification may be updated to reflect changes to LAU boundaries or changes to population distributions for 1 km grid cells The frequency of such updates varies according to the source of information Changes to the degree of urbanisation classification resulting from a revision of population distributions for 1 km grid cells are less common and these may be expected every 10 years when new census data becomes available The next major update of the population grid is foreseen to take place for the 2021 reference year Annual updates of the degree of urbanisation classification should be made to reflect changes to LAU boundaries These modifications can be implemented in two ways applying the degree of urbanisation methodology as described above for the new layer of LAUs or estimating the degree of urbanisation based on changes to LAU boundaries The first approach is more labour intensive while the second is particularly suitable if boundary changes for LAUs are relatively small or consist principally of merging LAUs especially if these have the same degree of urbanisation Updating the degree of urbanisation to reflect changes in LAU boundaries LAU boundaries may change over time in three different ways LAUs can merge they may undergo a boundary shift or they may be split The most common change for LAUs within the EU in recent years has been for two or more units to be merged boundary shifts have been less common while splitting units apart has been rare Case 1 LAU mergers Merging two LAUs with different degrees of urbanisation may be resolved by giving precedence to the more densely populated unit when merging LAUs composed of a city and a town or suburb reclassify the new LAU as a city when merging LAUs composed of a town or suburb and a rural area reclassify the new LAU as a town or suburb Such a process may be further refined by taking into account the relative population sizes of the two LAUs Case 1a LAU mergers involving the same degree of urbanisation The degree of urbanisation is additive meaning that if two LAUs classified as thinly populated areas are subsequently merged into a single LAU then they will remain a thinly populated area this is also true for the other degrees of urbanisation Case 1b LAU mergers involving a densely populated area The degree or urbanisation methodology specifies that each high density cluster should have at least 75 % of its population covered by densely populated LAUs It also foresees a method to match densely populated areas with the geographic areas of administrative or political functions and links the degree of urbanisation to the city data collection exercise This means that any merger involving an LAU that has been previously classified as a densely populated area should result in the newly merged LAU also being classified as a densely populated area Case 1c LAU mergers involving thinly populated and intermediate density areas These mergers can be addressed in two simple ways using the population of the urban cluster or using the population of the LAUs In the first case if the population of the relevant urban cluster s is available then add the population inhabiting the urban cluster for each of the LAUs and divide this by the total population of the new LAU to determine the new degree of urbanisation If more than 50 % of the population of the new LAU lives in an urban cluster the new LAU should be classified as an intermediate density area If the population share is less than 50 % then the new LAU should be classified as a thinly populated area In the second case if the population living in the urban cluster cannot be identified then the degree of urbanisation may be determined based on the population distribution between the LAUs If more than 50 % of the population of the new LAU comes from thinly populated LAUs the new LAU should be classified as thinly populated If more than 50 % of the population of the new LAU comes from intermediate density LAUs the new LAU should be classified as intermediate density Case 2 LAU boundary shifts Whereas mergers can be dealt with using simple methods boundary shifts cannot always be as reliably addressed Indeed in some rare cases boundary shifts between LAUs that have the same degree of urbanisation can lead to a change in classification Such complexity means that a simple rule of thumb is often the preferred and most efficient approach A simple rule may be established whereby if an LAU loses less than 25 % of its previous population or gains less than 50 % of its population due to boundary shifts then the degree of urbanisation does not change This rule of thumb is likely to cover 90 % of all boundary shifts and ensures continuity If this is not the case then further investigation is required as described below Case 2a changes in the degree of urbanisation from boundary shifts are excluded For each LAU the share of population in the three different types of population grids cells is known For example if as the result of a boundary shift the population of an LAU that has 100 % of its population in rural grid cells shrinks then it will remain a thinly populated area Equally if a boundary shift for an LAU that has 100 % of its population in rural grid cells rises then the new LAU would need to more than double its population before it could potentially become an intermediate density area As a result if the boundary shift leads to a change in population that is too small to tip the population share of the revised LAU below 50 % of the relevant grid cells it keeps the same degree of urbanisation Case 2b changes in the degree of urbanisation from boundary shifts are unlikely but cannot be excluded If the boundary shift leads to a change in population that is theoretically sufficient to the tip the population share of the revised LAU below or above 50 % but the shift is between LAUs with the same degree of urbanisation then the same degree of urbanisation should be kept Case 2c changes in the degree of urbanisation from boundary shifts are likely In some cases changes in the degree of urbanisation are likely Take for example if a city were to gain part of a suburb as a result of a boundary shift The city a densely populated area gains a small number of additional inhabitants which does not have an impact on its degree of urbanisation The suburb loses some of its population that is reclassified to the city As a result the population in the revised LAU covered by the suburb may have less than 50 % of its population living in an urban cluster in which case it should subsequently be reclassified as a thinly populated area Case 3 splitting LAUs This type of change is relatively rare Therefore the main recommendation is one of continuity in other words maintain the same degree of urbanisation If an LAU is split the new LAUs should have the same degree of urbanisation as the old LAU If there are concerns that the new LAUs may have different urban structures the same approaches as described for boundary shifts can be used Future developments At the time of writing a 2021 population and housing census implementing regulation is in the process of being adopted by the European Commission It includes an article for 1 km population grid statistics as well as information for annual counts of populations it also foresees more detailed analyses including population by sex population by age number of employed persons population by place of birth population by usual place of residence one year prior to the census Eurostat are also discussing post 2021 census developments with national statistical authorities It is possible that from the mid 2020s onwards the ESS will agree to produce annual counts of populations based on usual place of residence for a 1 km grid with data to be made available within 12 months of the end of the reference period  --http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#versionInfo-->

http://schema.org/Dataset  --http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#versionInfo-->  Historical developments Urban and rural developments are central concepts used by a wide range of policymakers researchers national administrations and international organisations While these terms may be readily understood by the general public a clear statistical definition at an international level has proved elusive The degree of urbanisation classification was originally introduced in 1991 distinguishing between densely intermediate and thinly populated areas It was based on information for numbers of inhabitants population density and the contiguity of local administrative units at level 2 LAU2 otherwise referred to as municipalities As LAU2s varied considerably in terms of their size area the results were compromised in terms of comparability this was especially the case for EU Member States characterised by relatively large or relatively small LAUs Note also that the original classification for the degree of urbanisation was based on different population density thresholds to those currently employed for example densely populated areas had a lower threshold of 500 inhabitants per km which led to many smaller towns and some suburbs being classified within this category In 2011 the OECD together with the European Commission s Directorates General for Regional and Urban Policy Eurostat Agriculture and Rural Development and the Joint Research Centre JRC started working on revising the degree of urbanisation classification As a result the methodology has been improved see A harmonised definition of cities and rural areas the new degree of urbanisation WP 01 2014 The refinement of the methodology also provided an opportunity to harmonise several similar but not identical spatial concepts Changes over time that impact on the classification The degree of urbanisation classification should be updated to reflect any changes to the underlying sources of information that are used in the compilation of this classification As such the classification may be updated to reflect changes to LAU boundaries or changes to population distributions for 1 km grid cells The frequency of such updates varies according to the source of information Changes to the degree of urbanisation classification resulting from a revision of population distributions for 1 km grid cells are less common and these may be expected every 10 years when new census data becomes available The next major update of the population grid is foreseen to take place for the 2021 reference year Annual updates of the degree of urbanisation classification should be made to reflect changes to LAU boundaries These modifications can be implemented in two ways applying the degree of urbanisation methodology as described above for the new layer of LAUs or estimating the degree of urbanisation based on changes to LAU boundaries The first approach is more labour intensive while the second is particularly suitable if boundary changes for LAUs are relatively small or consist principally of merging LAUs especially if these have the same degree of urbanisation Updating the degree of urbanisation to reflect changes in LAU boundaries LAU boundaries may change over time in three different ways LAUs can merge they may undergo a boundary shift or they may be split The most common change for LAUs within the EU in recent years has been for two or more units to be merged boundary shifts have been less common while splitting units apart has been rare Case 1 LAU mergers Merging two LAUs with different degrees of urbanisation may be resolved by giving precedence to the more densely populated unit when merging LAUs composed of a city and a town or suburb reclassify the new LAU as a city when merging LAUs composed of a town or suburb and a rural area reclassify the new LAU as a town or suburb Such a process may be further refined by taking into account the relative population sizes of the two LAUs Case 1a LAU mergers involving the same degree of urbanisation The degree of urbanisation is additive meaning that if two LAUs classified as thinly populated areas are subsequently merged into a single LAU then they will remain a thinly populated area this is also true for the other degrees of urbanisation Case 1b LAU mergers involving a densely populated area The degree or urbanisation methodology specifies that each high density cluster should have at least 75 % of its population covered by densely populated LAUs It also foresees a method to match densely populated areas with the geographic areas of administrative or political functions and links the degree of urbanisation to the city data collection exercise This means that any merger involving an LAU that has been previously classified as a densely populated area should result in the newly merged LAU also being classified as a densely populated area Case 1c LAU mergers involving thinly populated and intermediate density areas These mergers can be addressed in two simple ways using the population of the urban cluster or using the population of the LAUs In the first case if the population of the relevant urban cluster s is available then add the population inhabiting the urban cluster for each of the LAUs and divide this by the total population of the new LAU to determine the new degree of urbanisation If more than 50 % of the population of the new LAU lives in an urban cluster the new LAU should be classified as an intermediate density area If the population share is less than 50 % then the new LAU should be classified as a thinly populated area In the second case if the population living in the urban cluster cannot be identified then the degree of urbanisation may be determined based on the population distribution between the LAUs If more than 50 % of the population of the new LAU comes from thinly populated LAUs the new LAU should be classified as thinly populated If more than 50 % of the population of the new LAU comes from intermediate density LAUs the new LAU should be classified as intermediate density Case 2 LAU boundary shifts Whereas mergers can be dealt with using simple methods boundary shifts cannot always be as reliably addressed Indeed in some rare cases boundary shifts between LAUs that have the same degree of urbanisation can lead to a change in classification Such complexity means that a simple rule of thumb is often the preferred and most efficient approach A simple rule may be established whereby if an LAU loses less than 25 % of its previous population or gains less than 50 % of its population due to boundary shifts then the degree of urbanisation does not change This rule of thumb is likely to cover 90 % of all boundary shifts and ensures continuity If this is not the case then further investigation is required as described below Case 2a changes in the degree of urbanisation from boundary shifts are excluded For each LAU the share of population in the three different types of population grids cells is known For example if as the result of a boundary shift the population of an LAU that has 100 % of its population in rural grid cells shrinks then it will remain a thinly populated area Equally if a boundary shift for an LAU that has 100 % of its population in rural grid cells rises then the new LAU would need to more than double its population before it could potentially become an intermediate density area As a result if the boundary shift leads to a change in population that is too small to tip the population share of the revised LAU below 50 % of the relevant grid cells it keeps the same degree of urbanisation Case 2b changes in the degree of urbanisation from boundary shifts are unlikely but cannot be excluded If the boundary shift leads to a change in population that is theoretically sufficient to the tip the population share of the revised LAU below or above 50 % but the shift is between LAUs with the same degree of urbanisation then the same degree of urbanisation should be kept Case 2c changes in the degree of urbanisation from boundary shifts are likely In some cases changes in the degree of urbanisation are likely Take for example if a city were to gain part of a suburb as a result of a boundary shift The city a densely populated area gains a small number of additional inhabitants which does not have an impact on its degree of urbanisation The suburb loses some of its population that is reclassified to the city As a result the population in the revised LAU covered by the suburb may have less than 50 % of its population living in an urban cluster in which case it should subsequently be reclassified as a thinly populated area Case 3 splitting LAUs This type of change is relatively rare Therefore the main recommendation is one of continuity in other words maintain the same degree of urbanisation If an LAU is split the new LAUs should have the same degree of urbanisation as the old LAU If there are concerns that the new LAUs may have different urban structures the same approaches as described for boundary shifts can be used Future developments At the time of writing a 2021 population and housing census implementing regulation is in the process of being adopted by the European Commission It includes an article for 1 km population grid statistics as well as information for annual counts of populations it also foresees more detailed analyses including population by sex population by age number of employed persons population by place of birth population by usual place of residence one year prior to the census Eurostat are also discussing post 2021 census developments with national statistical authorities It is possible that from the mid 2020s onwards the ESS will agree to produce annual counts of populations based on usual place of residence for a 1 km grid with data to be made available within 12 months of the end of the reference period (Probability: 0.07377417385578156)
