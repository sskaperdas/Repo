The EU 28 s share of world exports of goods and services was 17 8 % in 2017 On average every day the EU 28 exports millions of euros worth of goods and services to the rest of the world while it imports millions more While the value of the EU s international trade in goods and services with the rest of the world has expanded at a relatively fast pace compared with the value of trade between EU Member States intra EU trade this has not prevented a gradual reduction in the EU s share of global trade Between 2007 and 2012 the EU 28 s share of global trade fell strongly before recovering somewhat through until 2017 In 2017 some 17 8 % of world exports for goods and services originated from the EU 28 as such its share of world exports was 1 0 percentage points lower than a decade earlier 18 8 % but 1 3 percentage points higher than the share 16 5 % recorded in 2012 It should be noted that the high share in 2007 preceded the global financial and economic crisis which impacted strongly and for several years on the EU s economy By contrast there was a more marked reduction in the share of the EU 28 in world imports for goods and services as its share of the global trade was 16 3 % in 2017 a reduction of 3 7 percentage points compared with a decade earlier The most striking feature concerning developments for world shares of international trade in goods and services between 2007 and 2017 was the continued progression of China as one of the world s leading trading nations China s share of the world exports for goods and services rose from 9 8 % to 13 5 % during the period under consideration while its share of imports grew at an even faster pace increasing by 5 1 percentage points to reach 12 6 % in 2017 see Figure 3  --https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/NLP4StatRef/ontology/hasParagraph-->  https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/NLP4StatRef/ontology/enps_lfsa_act (Probability: 0.00030307972338050604)
